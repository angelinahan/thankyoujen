          Hi Jen!<br />
          I feel really lucky to have had you as a professor, and that we got to
          work together twice! You're so good at giving critique that is kind
          but also challenges me to push my work further. Thank you for being an
          amazing professor. You've had such a positive influence on me and my
          work, and I'll miss our capstone class.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
          I would love to stay in touch and hear what you're up to. (I'm really
          excited to hear about the creative computing minor!) I'll still be
          reachable at my Northeastern email (han.ang@northeastern.edu) or at my
          regular email (angelinahan18@gmail.com).
        </p>
        <p>Hope you have a relaxing summer!</p>
        <p>â™¥ Angelina</p>
