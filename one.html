          5D is interactivity and behavior: including action, operation,

              This class was my first real introduction to net art. In high
              school, I was obsessed with Rafaël Rozendaal's net art websites. I
              thought it would be cool to make art like that one day, but I
              didn't know what net art was called or how to find other works
              like it. In 5D, I started learning the vocabulary and context
              around net art.

              I entered Northeastern as a CS and Media Arts major, but switched
              to CS and Design in my second semester in part because the
              description for 5D Fundamentals sounded so interesting. I'm so
              glad I did -- taking this class and working with you was one of
              the most formative experiences I had here.

              This reading expanded the way I looked at design. I realized for
              the first time that design could be conceptual, which was amazing
              because I loved conceptual art. Being in your 5D class helped me
              see the intersections between art, design, and coding. I had come
              into college as someone who really liked painting, and I was
              having a hard time figuring out how art fit with my major. This
              class helped me see the possibilities and crossovers, and made me
              so much more excited about CS and Design.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
              <br />I loved this project. My fictional object was called the
              Third Eye, and it randomly recorded the user for 10 seconds each
              day and stitched it together to form an unfiltered record of the
              user's daily existence. As part of it, I recorded myself for hours
              every day and used a random generator to choose 10 second clips to
              stitch together. It's interesting to look back on, because the way
              I was working 3 years ago was similar to how I work now,
              physically experiencing the processes I make up. It's kind of
              comforting to look back and see that I've always been interested
              in making art about mundane, everyday moments. My skills and the
              quality of my output have increased, but I'm still thinking about
              similar ideas. This project was an important step in that
              trajectory. Thank you.<br />

              I remember sitting in Snell, painstakingly working on my website.
              It was so fun customizing my intro page and looking up different
              tags! You made it really manageable and fun to get started with
              web development with this project. It's funny how things
              snowball...what started here turned into a personal project to
              make my own portfolio website, which helped me get a web
              development coop, which helped me get a second web development
              coop, which turned into a full-time front-end development job
              post-grad. Freshman year me would be <b>so</b> surprised I'd get
              paid to do this one day. If I ever do that origin story zine
              project, I'm including this one in there.
