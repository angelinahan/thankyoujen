            <p>
              I'm so glad I was able to join your capstone class in my last
              semester. It feels like a full-circle moment that my time as a CS
              and Design major here is bookended by 5D and Media Arts Capstone.

            <p>
              I had the beginnings of the idea for A Day in Your Clothes a year
              or two ago, but I think developing it in this environment made it
              even stronger. The project was initially so exploratory and broad;
              it was helpful to hear that being loose and exploratory wasn't a
              bad thing.

            <h2 class="sc-jqUVSM jBDIqL">03. Concept and Practice</h2>
            Reflecting on my current practice helped me see themes in my own
            work that I never saw before. I've had difficulty summarizing my
            work in the past because I like using many different mediums. It was
            so helpful to sit down and think about my influences and past work.

            <p>
              Talking about this process was such helpful practical knowledge. I
              really appreciate everything you shared, and I also really enjoyed
              seeing your work (it's so cool)! After this lecture, I ended up
              submitting a piece to a magazine and being accepted! I think I'm
              going to participate in a Zoom event they're having in a few
              weeks, so that will be the first time I talk about my work in
              public! Baby steps are happening -- thanks for making it all seem
              possible and attainable.

            <p>
              Installing my final project was so exciting. I'm glad you
              mentioned the goal was to show it in Gallery360 early in the
              semester -- knowing that it would be a physical, in-person
              experience definitely influenced the form and allowed me to
              consider the design of the installation.
